Because there is to way to source/search either the MET API or the csv dataset by artistic movement (in this case Surrealism and Dadaism), I am using my background in art history to compile a list of relevant artists here, and then search for their works and extract the titles of their works from the MET dataset.

This list can be added to or changed based on feedback and further research.

I started with the most well known names, searched through exhibitions to find new (to me) artists, and emphasized included women in this list, many of whom have been overlooked for their contributions and involvement in these movements.

Some of these artists may not have personally associated with the Surrealist movement but I've included them because of their influence to the movement.
