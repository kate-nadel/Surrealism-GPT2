Because there is to way to source/search either the MET API or the csv dataset by artistic movement (in this case Surrealism and Dadaism), I did a little research to compile a list of relevant artists here, and then search for their works and extract the titles of their works from the MET dataset. In the data file they are listed under artists = []

This list can be added to or changed based on feedback and further research.

I started with the most well known names, searched through exhibitions to find new (to me) artists, and emphasized an effort to include women in this list, many of whom have been overlooked for their contributions and involvement in these movements.

Some of these artists may not have personally called themselves Surrealist artists or explicitly associated with Surrealism but I've included them because of their influence to the movement.

Finally, I recognize that there are issues with drawing out all titles by an artist based on my own proclamation that they were relevant to Surrealism. Accepted art historical practice would prefer to call a work of art Surrealist, rather than an artist. Even the most influential "Surrealist artists" made work that is not considered surrealist. Not every work by one of these artists in the dataset would be considered a "Surrealist work of art," and thus, many of the works ultimately included in the training data are probably not actually Surrealist works of art. From an art historical perspective, this project is not entirely accurate. For the purposes of text generation, and the nature of GPT2, it's okay for now.
