# Surrealism-GPT2
Final project for Programming for Cultural Heritage @ Pratt Institute. Fall 2020 with Matt Miller

## Workflow

1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess">MetObject CSV</a>, and run the data.py script to write out a CSV of only the titles of works of art by artists who are considered Surrealist (see the ArtHistNotes file for my process for selecting artists and issues with the methodology)
